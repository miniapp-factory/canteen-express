The changes you’re asking for will touch the following files in your repository:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app’s title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new logo image for the app.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the edits.
