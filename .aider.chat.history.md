The changes you’re asking for will touch the following files in your repository:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app’s title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new logo image for the app.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the edits.

#### Extend the app by building a menu screen that displays meal cards. Add a search bar component that accepts typed keywords. Implement the logic to filter visible meals on the page as the user types. The meals must be fetched from a database or API storage when the app opens. And rename the name of the app to Base Canteen Express  

The following files will need to be added or edited to implement the requested features:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the app title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – generate a new logo for “Base Canteen Express”.  
3. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – import and render the new menu screen.  
4. `mini-app/components/menu.tsx` – new component that fetches meals and displays them.  
5. `mini-app/components/search-bar.tsx` – new component that captures user input.  
6. `mini-app/components/meal-card.tsx` – new component that renders a single meal.  
7. `mini-app/lib/api.ts` – helper to fetch meals from your database or API.  

Add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes.

I’ll need the new component files to implement the menu, search bar, meal card, and API helper.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for them:

- `mini-app/components/menu.tsx`  
- `mini-app/components/search-bar.tsx`  
- `mini-app/components/meal-card.tsx`  
- `mini-app/lib/api.ts`  

Once those are added, I’ll also update `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and `mini-app/app/page.tsx` accordingly.
